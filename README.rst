micatutorial3 is a lightweight cross-platform toolbox primarily intended 
for macroscale gradient mapping and analysis of 
neuroimaging and connectome level data. The current version 
of BrainSpace is available in Python and MATLAB, programming 
languages widely used by the neuroimaging and network neuroscience 
communities. The toolbox also contains several maps that allow for 
exploratory analysis of gradient correspondence with other 
brain-derived features, together with tools to generate spatial null models.

For installation instructions, examples and documentation of micatutorial3 see
our `documentation <https://micatutorial3.readthedocs.io>`_.

Happy gradient analysis!
